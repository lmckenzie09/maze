Python script that randomly generates a square maze with a 2x2 center goal.

Arguments: An even number that is greater than or equal to 6

Notes:
Even though there are multiple dead ends, there is usually only one path
to the center from any corner. Essentially, these maps aren't useful when
trying to test if your robot can find a more efficient path to the goal
after getting there 

Fixes:
2/15 It is now never possible for the center to be completely blocked off
Bugs:
2/15 Sometimes there are still pieces of the maze blocked off. Mostly in a 2x1 or L shape
2/13 There is a chance that the center will be completely blocked off.
